# Project Ideas

## Go API or REST Server

Create a simple backend using Go to make a simple API like generating a random quote etc.

Goals:

- Learn Go syntax
- Learn about web backends and requests
- Could possibly host this on Linode ?
- Could possibly use Docker ?

## Multiplayer game

Turn based strategy game. 
Two players are placed on a grid at random locations, and cannot see other squares or the other player, as if they are in the dark.
Each turn, the player can do one of the following:
- Move to another square
- Reveal a square in any direction
- Attack
The player that hits the other player first wins

Kind of like chess meets battleship?
Players leave "torches" where they've been, so the other player can follow the trail, or set false ones.

Backend could be in Go or Python.

The first iteration of user side code could be a CLI in Go or Rust.

## Create static website using Hugo

Using Hugo and Github Pages, host a static Hugo site to post a resume, kind of a blog type site.
